IAM: is a global service
	create users and can be grouped
	group developers and group operations also same person can be in 2 or more groups
	users or groupes can be assigned JSON documents called policies
	these policies define the permissions of the users
	in aws you apply the least privilage principle, dont give more services than a user needs
	
	not a best practice to chose root user
	users => create user -> create username ->  i want to create a iam user
	you can create a group ex: admin group with permissions of admin, choose password options
	once the user is created, you can see the signin url on right, and you can change the alias of sign in url
	now you can login using the new alias in a new private window

	we can add the user to different groups
	we can also create groups ex: developers group
	in policies we can update permissions by editing the json of policies
	IAM password policy: Iam MFA overview: 
	you can set up password policy : password type
	you can also set MFA: multi factor authentication (password you know + security device you own)
		google authenticator(phone only) or Authy(multiple)
		yubiKey by yubico(3rd party)
		gemalto and hardware  key fob MFA device for aws givCloud (us)
	
	Accout settings: 	
	edit password policy	
	
	access aws 
		aws console
		aws command line interface
		aws sdk
		all are protected by access keys
		
	set up aws cmd: install aws cli 2 after googling, download and install msi finish installing
	open cmd -> aws --version
	create access key -> click on username under users tab in IAM, click on security credentials -> scroll down and click on create access key
	select cli -> next -> create access key - download csv
	configure aws cli:
	enter access key 
	secret access key 
	default region 
	default output format(none): blank
	
	in cmd: type: iam list users -> will list all users
	cloudshell -> check region -> alternative to teminal -> top right corner of console
	iam roles for services: creating role for ec2 for accessing aws services
	click on roles tab: aws service -> select a service form dropdown -> select ec2 -> attach a policy (ex: IAMReadOnlyAccess)-> 
		role name -> create role
		
	iam securitytools -> 
	iam credentials report(account level)
		list accout users and status of their various creds
	iam access advisor(user level)
		show service permissions granted to users and when it was accessed last time, you can revise policies based on this info
	
	click on credentialsreport and download: 
	access advisor: user usename access advisor


AWS EC2: 
	EC2: Elastic cloud compute -> one of the most popular aws offering -> knowing ec2 is fundamental to understand how the cloud works.
	Infrastructure as a service
	mainly consists in the capability of:
		Renting virtual machines(EC2)
		storing data on virtual drives: (EBS)
		distributing load across machines(ELB)
		scaling the services useing an auto-scaling group(ASG)

	ECS sizing and configuration options:
		OS: linux(popular), windows, macos
		how much compute power and cores(cpu)
		how much RaM
		how much storage space
			network attached (EBS AND EFS)
			hardware (EC2 instance store)
		network card: speed of the card and public IP address
		firewall rules: security group
		Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 user data`
	ec2 user data: 
		it is possible to bootstrap out instances using ec2 user data script
		bootstraping means lauching commands when machine starts
		script is only run once at the instance first start
		ec2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as 
			installing updates
			installing softwares
			downloading common files from the internet
			anything you can think of
		EC2 user data script runs with the root user

	ec2 instance types: example
		t2.micro
		t2.xlarge
		c5d.xlarge
		r5.16xlarge
		m5.8xlarge	
			
	lauching EC2:
	ec2 console -> Name(my first instance)-> choose os(amazon linux(free tier)) -> 64bit -> instance type(t2 micro) -> keypair to login-> (used to connect securely with instance, this is necessary if we use ssh utility) 
	create keypair -> rsa -> .pem (for win 10 and higher ) .ppk (win 7 or 8, this will use putty) ->
	network settings -> under security group firewall -> will go with defaults and use alow ssh traffic from (anywhere) also select http option for now -> 
	configure storage (defaults) (advanced will show additional options) -> check delete on termination option to "yes" -> 
	advanced details -> user data -> it is used to pass script on the first launch (below is the script)
		(
			#!/bin/bash
			# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
			# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
			yum update -y
			yum install -y httpd
			systemctl start httpd
			systemctl enable httpd
			echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
		)
	finally check the summary -> launch the instance -> view all instances -> it will take 10 to 15 secs to change from pending to running

	instance details you can find private ip, public ip, copy public ip and paste in the browser and check if its working else use http:// before ip.
	once you stop and start the instance, public ip will be updated private will be the same.
	m5.2xlarge - 
		m: instance class
		5: generation 
		2xlarge: size within the instance class

	compute optimised instance types 
	c5, c6 starts with c
	memory optimised instance types
	r5, r5a starts with r
	storage optimised instance types
	i H starts with

	ec2instances.info -> website to check different instances of ec2

	introduction to security groups
	sg are fundamental of network security in aws
	they control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
		we create a sg around ec2 instance to have rules on inbound and outbound traffic.

	sg only contains allow rules
	sg rules can reference by ip or by sg
	
	good to know 
	sg can be attached to multiple instances
	can be locked down to region 
	if traffic is blocked the instance wont see it 
	it is good to maintain one seperate security group for ssh access
	if app is not accessible or throwing "timeout" error then it may be security group issue
	if its connection refused error then it is app error or its not launched
	by default all inbout traffic is blocked and outbound traffic is authorised

	classic ports to know
	22 = SSH(secure shell) - log into a linux instance
	21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
	22 = sftp (secure file transfer protocol) = upload files using ssh
	80 = http - access unsecured websites
	443 = https - access secured websites
	3389 = RDP (remote desktop protocol) = log into a windows instance

	security group: 
	network and security -> security groups
	inbound rules: you can see tcp and http if you delete http you will not be able to access you instance public ip from browser
	or you can add other ports

	outbound -> all traffic - access whole internet


	SSH: how to connect
	can be used on mac or linux and window >=10 less than win 10 use putty
	EC2 instance connect: which will use a web browser to connect and works on all os
